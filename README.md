# Huffman-Code-Generator
The included .m file is a fully functioning MATLAB implementation of a Huffman code generator. It takes in a label vector (the signal values) and a probability vector (the frequency distribution of each signal value). The script returns the Huffman coding of these signal values.

In the context of digital image/video compression, we could be asked to compress an image. If we had the pixel intensity frequency distribution we could apply a Huffman method to 

Huffman coding, in a nutshell, takes advantage of the fact that certain signal values appear more frequently than others. These less frequent values can be encoded with more bits, where more frequently occuring values are encoded with less bits.
